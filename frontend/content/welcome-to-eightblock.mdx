## Why eightblock exists

Open knowledge powers open source. We saw hundreds of guides, proposals, and governance docs scattered across Discords, Notion pages, and personal blogs. eightblock pulls the best learnings into one canonical home—fully open, remixable, and maintained by the community.

## What to expect

- Deep dives into Cardano governance mechanics and CIP updates
- Tutorials for full-stack builders shipping on-chain apps
- Stories from Intersect working groups and funding rounds
- Open discussions about treasury transparency, audits, and operations

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo and add your MDX article under `/frontend/content`.
2. Run `pnpm dev` in both the frontend and backend workspaces for live previews.
3. Submit a pull request with screenshots, diagrams, or demos. We merge early and iterate together.

> eightblock is governed by its contributors. Join the conversation in GitHub Discussions and help mentor the next wave of blockchain builders.
